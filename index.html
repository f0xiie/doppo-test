            <h2>Hello</h2>
            <p class="intro">I'm Doppo Kunikida (国くに木き田だ 獨ど歩っぽ), a member of the Armed Detective Agency. I'm the owner
                of the ability
                named The Matchless Poet.

                <h3>Ability</h3>
                <p>The Matchless Poet allows me to make objects written on the papers of my notebook come into
                    existence. However, it does not work on objects larger than the notebook. Such objects include wire
                    guns, handguns, grenades, and flashbangs. I'm shown to be able to use pre-written notes as a means
                    for object summons of mine, which can be especially convenient if one of my hands is bound and
                    incapacitated. Also, I'm able to remotely activate my ability, transforming pre-written notes
                    into objects, which come in handy when supporting other members from afar.</p>

                    <li>Martial Arts: I'm proficient in martial arts, being able to restrain and overthrow people. With
                        this, I also have enhance strength, being able to rip John Steinbeck's vines attached to my arm.
                        I learned this skill from Fukuzawa, to which I stated that I'll never once win against him.

            <h3>Before the Armed Detective Agency</h3>
            <p class="contact-message">Alongside working in the Agency, I previously worked as an algebra teacher at Shin-Tsuruya
                Institute twice a week. Because of the Azure King case, I left my job at the Institute to devote myself
                entirely to the Agency.</p>
